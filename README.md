# VehicleTravelApp

This is my first application.
This program is used to record the mileage of vehicles.
At the beginning, you choose the type of saving the entered data, if you want the data to be saved, you choose saving in a file, otherwise, after the end of the program, the data will be automatically deleted.
In the next step, you select the vehicle type, then enter the vehicle and driver details, then enter the vehicle routes in turn.
You can also use the shortcuts in the menu, which store the data of your vehicles and frequently traveled routes.
